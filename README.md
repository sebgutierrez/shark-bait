# A 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge

Our project — Shark Bait — takes on the **Sharks from Space** challenge

### Challenge Summary

Earth’s ocean is one of the most powerful habitats in our universe, supporting a range of life that sustains ecosystems and habitability across the globe. It is common to measure photosynthetic activity in the ocean from space, but far more challenging to track top predators. Your challenge is to create a mathematical framework for identifying sharks and predicting their foraging habitats using NASA satellite data, and also to suggest a new conceptual model of a tag (a small electronic device that can be attached to an animal to track and study its movement) that could measure not only where sharks are, but also what they are eating, and in real time transmit that data back to users to enable development of predictive models.

### Challenge Background

Sharks are important apex predators, regulating prey levels and ensuring species diversity needed for healthy ecosystems. Sharks are also facing unprecedented fishing pressure and determining where sharks feed and move is critical to protect crucial shark habitats. It would be useful to be able to identify foraging hotspots and quantify the ecological links between physical oceanographic features, phytoplankton communities, and predator movement patterns. Data from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission as well as the Plankton, Aerosols, Clouds, and Ecosystems (PACE) mission can be used to track eddies in the ocean where sharks may choose to live.

There are several trophic steps (i.e., steps in the food chain) between phytoplankton (readily visible from PACE data) and sharks, so a mathematical/physically realistic model for shark foraging behavior must take that into consideration. There are also several variables that potentially affect shark behavior. For example, when are sharks at the surface, and when may they want to be deeper in the ocean? What role might temperature play? What are the ecological consequences of their locations and behavior?

### Challenge Objectives

Your challenge is to create a mathematical framework for identifying sharks and predicting their foraging habitats using NASA satellite data, and also suggest a new conceptual model of a tag (a small electronic device that can be attached to an animal to track and study its movement) that could measure not only where sharks are, but also what they are eating, and in real time transmit that data to users to enable development of predictive models.

Can you identify foraging hotspots and quantify the ecological links between physical oceanographic features, phytoplankton communities, and predator movement patterns? You could even come up with a new satellite measurement that would help to identify these crucial shark habitats!

Your project could look different depending on what you investigate. For example, you could present your hypotheses and data-driven preliminary results in a short video. Or you could build and run a simple mathematical model that uses satellite data as input and outputs graphical products that show relationships between shark activity and sea surface variables. You could also develop global maps of expected shark activity. But no matter what, don’t forget to use satellite products from NASA as input!
